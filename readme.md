# SUDOKU

## Developed in C++ language.

I'm trying my best to make a full working game (on terminal), highly personalized and structured. I'm putting in use the creation of personal libraries and functions to improve code's readability.

> [!NOTE]
> You can play the current game by downloading **sudoku.exe**

I pretend to program different game modes, themes, settings and even a local multiplayer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The executable file might be considered a virus, just bypass it by clicking **More information** then **Download anyway** or something like that.

## Control with WASD or arrow keys.
